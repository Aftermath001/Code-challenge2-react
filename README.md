# Code-challenge2-react
// README.md
This project allows users to manage a virtual army of bots. The user can view all available bots in the BotCollection component, select and add individual bots to their army in the YourBotArmy component, release a bot from their army, and permanently delete a bot from both the frontend and backend.
# Bot Army App

This app allows you to create and manage your own bot army!

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the Array.
